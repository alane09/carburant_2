# Next Steps for Frontend Optimization

Based on our recent code cleanup and organization efforts, here are the recommended next steps for further improving the frontend codebase:

## 1. Complete Component Consolidation

- **Upload Client Components**: Review and consolidate additional upload-related components
- **Filter Components**: Create a unified filter system that works across different sections
- **Data Tables**: Build a configurable data table component that can be used throughout the application

## 2. API Layer Improvements

- **Deduplicate API Calls**: Further consolidate duplicate API calls in `src/lib/api.ts`
- **Domain-specific Services**: Create dedicated service files for different domains (vehicles, reports, etc.)
- **API Client Factory**: Implement a factory pattern for API clients to ensure consistency

## 3. State Management Enhancements

- **Context API Usage**: Evaluate current context implementations and optimize where needed
- **Server State Management**: Consider implementing React Query for server state management
- **Form State Management**: Use form libraries like React Hook Form consistently throughout the app

## 4. Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting for larger components and pages
- **Lazy Loading**: Add lazy loading for components that aren't immediately visible
- **Image Optimization**: Ensure all images are properly optimized and use Next.js Image component
- **Bundle Analysis**: Run bundle analysis and identify opportunities to reduce bundle size

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Component Tests**: Add unit tests for shared components
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for critical user flows
- **E2E Tests**: Consider implementing end-to-end tests for key features

## 6. Documentation Improvements

- **Component Documentation**: Add Storybook or similar tool for component documentation
- **API Documentation**: Document all API endpoints and their usage
- **Coding Standards**: Create a coding standards document to ensure consistency

## 7. Accessibility Improvements

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: Add proper aria attributes where needed
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards for color contrast

## Implementation Priority

1. Complete API layer improvements (highest impact)
2. Finish component consolidation
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Add testing infrastructure
5. Improve documentation
6. Enhance accessibility
