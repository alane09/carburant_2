# Frontend Cleanup and Optimization

This document outlines the improvements made to the frontend code organization and structure.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Consolidated Components

We've consolidated duplicate components to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy:

- **UploadHistoryTable**: Combined components from `src/components/historical/upload-history-table.tsx` and `src/components/upload/upload-history-table.tsx` into a unified component at `src/components/shared/upload-history-table.tsx`.

### 2. New Services and Hooks

We've implemented new centralized services and hooks for better code organization:

- **FileService**: Created a dedicated service for file management operations in `src/services/file-service.ts`.
- **useFileManagement**: Implemented a custom hook for file operations in `src/hooks/use-file-management.ts`.

### 3. Project Structure Improvements

- Created a `shared` components directory for reusable components.
- Added proper directory structure for `services`.
- Organized hooks with a centralized index file.
- Added a `logs` directory to keep log files separate from source code.

### 4. Build Process Improvements

- Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude build artifacts, logs, and temporary files.
- Created a cleanup script at `scripts/cleanup.ps1` to remove unnecessary files and maintain a clean codebase.

## Usage of Shared Components

### UploadHistoryTable

The shared UploadHistoryTable component supports multiple view modes and configurations:

```tsx
import { UploadHistoryTable } from '@/components/shared';

// Example usage with detailed variant
<UploadHistoryTable
  files={files}
  onViewDetails={handleViewDetails}
  onDeleteFile={handleDeleteFile}
  onDownloadFile={handleDownloadFile}
  variant="detailed"
  showFileSize={true}
  showRecordCount={true}
/>

// Example usage with simple variant
<UploadHistoryTable
  files={files}
  onDeleteFile={handleDeleteFile}
  variant="simple"
  showRegion={true}
/>
```

## Using the Cleanup Script

To clean up unnecessary files and build artifacts, run the cleanup script:

```powershell
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd c:\Users\ala\test1\frontend

# Run the cleanup script
.\scripts\cleanup.ps1
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Further Component Consolidation**: 
   - Consider consolidating similar filter components (e.g., date range selectors).
   - Create a unified data table component with configurable columns.

2. **API Optimization**:
   - Review and consolidate duplicate API calls.
   - Implement proper caching strategies for API responses.

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Add unit tests for shared components and services.
   - Implement integration tests for critical user flows.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain updated documentation for all shared components and services.
   - Add inline comments for complex logic.
